      Hi! I’m Your Name, a junior web developer with a passion for creating
      clean, user-friendly websites. My journey started with curiosity about
      how websites work, and now I’m building projects that bring ideas to life.

      My focus is on learning modern web technologies and contributing to
      real-world projects. I’m motivated by solving problems, continuous learning,
      and building meaningful applications.
